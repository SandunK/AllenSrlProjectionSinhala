The train goes from Galle to Matara
I go home
Father goes to work
Mother is going to cook
He goes to the Baptist church
Kasun goes to school
I see the dog
I saw him.
we saw the bus to Galle
I eat rice
Mother eats rice
She acts as a bride
Father acts as a machine operator
I kill him
The cat kills the rat
He didn't know health habits
